    The following is a sample dataset of shops and shoes:
    ${JSON.stringify(sampleData)}

    Your task is to help the user find the best shoe options based on their preferences and location. 
    Generate a list of shoes available in local shops within the user's specified radius and based on their shop preferences.

    Rules:
      - Response must be in JSON format.
      - Only include shoes available at shops within a radius of ${values.travelDistance} km from the user's location.
      - Consider the user's shop preference for ${values.shopType} (options: "local shop", "store chain", or "big brand").
      - Each shoe entry should include the following:
        - "title": The name of the shoe (e.g., Nike Air Max, Adidas Ultraboost).
        - "price": The price of the shoe in local currency.
        - "shop": The name of the shop selling the shoe.
        - "distance_to_shop": The distance from the user to the shop, measured in kilometers or miles.
        - "opening_hours": The operating hours of the shop.
        - "distance_from_me": How far the shop is from the user's location.
        - "image_url": A link to an image of the shoe.
        - "shop_url": A link to the shop where the user can purchase the shoe.
      - Be sure to include a mix of well-known brands like Adidas, Nike, Jordan, and other popular sports brands based on the preferences provided.
      - Format the response with shoe options ranked by proximity to the user and matching their store preference (local shop, chain, or big brand).

    The JSON object must include the following structure:

    [
      {
        "title": /* string */,
        "price": /* number */,
        "shop": /* string */,
        "distance_to_shop": /* number (in kilometers or miles) */,
        "opening_hours": /* string (e.g., "9 AM - 7 PM") */,
        "distance_from_me": /* number (in kilometers or miles) */,
        "image_url": /* string (link to image) */,
        "shop_url": /* string (link to shop) */
      },
      ...
    ]

    Format the response as a valid JSON object with all fields filled. Respond only with the completed JSON object without additional explanations.
